<h1>Human Development Index, applied to U.S. Census Tracts</h1>

<p>In a recent twitter discussion with 
@markasaurus @MBridegam and @evanlandman 
about <a href="http://ispol.com/sasha/hdi/">Alexandr Trubetskoy's map of U.S. counties by Human Development Index</a>,
we wondered if it would be possible to perform the HDI calculation at a lower level for a more fine grained look at the invisible dividing lines in American cities. The spatial inequality of the US is complicated, the result of centuries of investment and disinvestment, racial covenants, restrictive zoning, environmental degradation, loss of manufacturing jobs, redlining, transportation infrastructure, and thousands of other factors; but can the three components of the HDI -- Income, Education, and Life Expectancy -- capture these differences in a more subtle way than a single Census survey question?</p>

<h2>Data:</h2>

<p>The United Nation's Development Programme Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite measure of Life Expectancy, Education, and Income levels. It is commonly used to provide a single value for comparing development levels between different countries, but can also be used in a "disaggregated" manner to look at relative differences within a single country, administrative region, ethnic group, gender, etc.</p>

<p>As calculated, the HDI is a value from 0.0 to 1.0 where 1.0 is the highest possible level of development, and is the geometric mean of three component indices described below.</p>

<h3>Income Index</h3>

<p>The Income Index (II) is the simplest of the three component indices, and is based on the Gross National Income per capita (GNIpc). The value is normalized between the minimum and maximum observed incomes, and logarithmic scale is used to reflect the decreasing importance of marginal income near the max observed levels. For example, if the observed min and max GNIpc were $100 and $107,721 respectively, a GNIpc of $50,000 would be: (ln(50000)-ln(100))/(ln(107721)-ln(100)), or 0.890. In the United States, the values range from XX to YY in XYZ County (<a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_B19301&prodType=table">ACS 2012 5-yr table B19301</a>).</p>

<h3>Life Expectancy Index</h3>

<p>The Life Expectancy Index (LEI) is based on the life expectancy at birth (LE), normalized between the highest and lowest observed life expectancy values. For instance, if the observed min and max where 20 years and 83.57 years respectively, a LE of 55 years would result in an LEI of (55-20)/(83.57-20), or 0.551. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation <a href="http://ghdx.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/record/united-states-adult-life-expectancy-state-and-county-1987-2009">publishes</a> LE estimates for each county in the United States (for 1987-2009). LE estimates for each Census tract would be preferable, but this data is only available for a few counties (such as <a href="http://www.societyhealth.vcu.edu/Page.aspx?nav=204">Alameda County, CA</a>) where deaths have been geocoded to exact locations. In the IMHE data, the min observed LE is 70.2 years in McDowell County, WV and the max is 83.35 years in Marin County, CA. However, even Marin is lower than Japan's national LE of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy">84.6 years</a> (2013)! While my original calculation used 70.2 years as the lower bound, I subsequently lowered it to 50 years (close to the current observed global min of 47.5 years in Sierra Leone) to give slightly less weight to the LEI component.</p>

<h3>Education Index</h3>

<p>The third HDI component is the Education Index (EI), a measure of <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/mean-years-schooling-indicator-methodology-en.pdf">mean years of schooling</a> of adults over 25 years old (MYE) and <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w15902.pdf">expected years of schooling</a> for children entering today (EYS). The EI is the resulting geometric mean of (MYS / max MYS) and (EYS / max EYS).</p>

<p>Calculating MYS is fairly straight-forwarding using Census data (<a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_B15003&prodType=table">ACS 2012-5yr table B15003</a>) for educational attainment for the population 25 years and over. Each attainment level is assigned a duration, e.g. 14 years for high-school, 18 years for undergraduate degree, and multiplied by the percentage of the population with that attainment (I imagined an idealized world with universal Pre-K and Kindergarten). The MYS is then the sum of all levels. For instance, if 50% of the population has a high-school dipolma and 50% has a bachelor's degree, the result is (14*0.5)+(18*0.5), or 16 years.</p>

<p>Ideally, the EYS is the expected years of school for a child entering school age, and is calculated using the continuation rates for each subsequent level of school. I used the Census data for school enrollment by level of school for population 3 years and older (<a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_B14001&prodType=table">ACS 2012-5yr table B14001), combined with sex by age (<a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_B01001&prodType=table">ACS 2012-5yr table B01001) to calculate enrollment ratios for each grade. However, I did run into some issues with this calculation; the categories in the two tables did not perfectly line up, and grade school enrollment ratios can be mysteriously low in some places. The initial result wasn't much better than random, so I limited my comparison to only 9th-12th grades, college, and graduate school. So, a population where 100% of the relevant population is enrolled in k-8 (9 years, assumed), 90% for 9th-12th grades (4 years), 50% for college (4 years), and 10% for graduate school (5 years) would have an EYS of (1.0*9)+(0.9*4)+(0.5*4)+(0.1*5), or 15.1 years. The UN HDI caps EYS at 18-years, which I followed as well, and mostly affected areas immediately adjacent to Universities.</p>

<p>Finally, calculating the EI from the MYS and EYS uses the max observed values in each. If EYS was 15.1 with a max EYS of 18, and the MYS was 16 with a max MYS of 22, then the EI would be: ((15.1/18)*(16/22))**0.5, or 0.781.</p>

<h3>Final HDI</h3>

<p>The final HDI is the simple geometric mean of EI, II, and LEI, or (EI*II*LEI)**(1/3.0).</p>

<p>Blah blah blah.</p>
