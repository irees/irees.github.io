<h2><a href="hdi.html">View the map!</a>

<p>In a recent twitter discussion with 
<a href="https://twitter.com/markasaurus">@markasaurus</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MBridegam">@MBridegam</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/evanlandman">@evanlandman</a>
about <a href="http://ispol.com/sasha/hdi/">Alexandr Trubetskoy's map of U.S. counties by Human Development Index</a>,
we wondered if it would be possible to perform the HDI calculation at a lower level for a more fine grained look at the invisible dividing lines in American cities. The spatial inequality of the US is complicated, the result of centuries of investment and disinvestment, racial covenants, restrictive zoning, environmental degradation, loss of manufacturing jobs, redlining, transportation infrastructure, and thousands of other factors; but can the three components of the HDI -- Income, Education, and Life Expectancy -- capture these differences in a more subtle way than a single Census survey question?</p>

<h2>Calculating the Human Development Index</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/hdi">United Nation's Development Programme Human Development Index (HDI)</a> is a composite measure of Life Expectancy, Education, and Income levels. It is commonly used to provide a single value for comparing development levels between different countries, but can also be "disaggregated" to look at relative differences within a single country, administrative region, ethnic group, gender, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr_2013_en_technotes.pdf">HDI is calculated</a> as value from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 is the highest possible level of development, and is the geometric mean of the three component indices described below.</p>

<p>The <strong>Income Index (II)</strong> is the simplest of the three component indices, and is based on the Gross National Income per capita (GNIpc). The value is normalized between the minimum and maximum observed incomes, using a logarithmic scale to reflect the decreasing importance of marginal income near the max. For example, if the observed min and max GNIpc were $100 and $87,478 respectively, a GNIpc of $50,000 would be: 
</p>

<blockquote>
    (ln(income) - ln(income_min)) / (ln(income_max) - ln(income_min))<br />
    = (ln(50000) - ln(100)) / (ln(87478)-ln(100))<br />
    = 0.917
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>Life Expectancy Index (LEI)</strong> is based on the life expectancy at birth (LE), normalized between the highest and lowest observed life expectancy values. If the observed min and max were 20 years and 83.57 years respectively, a LE of 55 years would result in an LEI of:
</p>

<blockquote>
    (le - le_min) / (le_max - le_min)<br /> 
    = (55 - 20) / (83.6 - 20)<br /> 
    = 0.550
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>Education Index (EI)</strong> is the most complex of the three components, and is itself a composite of <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/mean-years-schooling-indicator-methodology-en.pdf">mean years of schooling</a> of adults over 25 years old (MYS) and <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w15902.pdf">expected years of schooling</a> for children entering school age (EYS).</p>

<p>Mean years of schooling can be calculated relatively easily using data on educational attainment. Each level of educational attainment is assigned a duration in years, and multiplied by the percentage of the population over 25 years old that completed that level. For example, if 60% of the population completed high-school (13 years), 20% completed an undergraduate degree (17 years), and 5% completed an M.D. (21 years), the MYS would be:
</p>
    
<blockquote>
    sum(level_completed_ratio * level_duration) for each level<br />
    = (0.6 * 13) + (0.2 * 17) + (0.05 * 21)<br />
    = 12.25
</blockquote>
    
<p>Expected years of schooling is the number of years of education a child entering school today would be expected to complete. Ideally, it should be calculated by following a single group of students over time. Alternatively, we can estimate the value using Census data on school enrollment. If we had 100% enrollment through 8th grade (9 years), 70% enrollment in 9th-12th grade (+4 years), and 20% undergraduate enrollment (+4 years), then the EYS would be:
</p>
    
<blockquote>
    sum(level_enrollment_ratio * level_duration) for each level<br />
    = (1.0 * 9) + (0.7 * 4) + (0.2 * 4)<br />
    = 12.6
</blockquote>

<p>The EI is the geometric mean of the normalized MYS and EYS values:</p>
    
<blockquote>
    EImys = (mys - mys_min) / (mys_max - mys_min)<br />
    EIeys = (eys - eys_min) / (eys_max - eys_min)<br />
    EI = ((EImys * EIeys)**0.5 - EImin) / (EImax - EImin)
</blockquote>

<p>And assuming a minimum of 0 years for all values, a maximum MYS of 13.3 years (United States), and a maximum EYS of 18 years, and a global maximum EI of 0.971 (New Zealand) using the previous values above:
</p>
     
<blockquote>
    EImys = (12.25 - 0) / (13.3 - 0) = 0.921<br />
    EIeys = (12.6 - 0) / (18.0 - 0) = 0.7<br />
    EI = ((0.921 * 0.7)**0.5 - 0) / (0.971 - 0)<br />
    = 0.827
</blockquote>
    
<p>And finally, the <strong>HDI</strong> is the geometric mean of the EI, II, and LEI:
</p>

<blockquote>
    (II * LEI * EI)**(1/3.0)<br />
    = (0.890 * 0.551 * 0.827)**(1/3.0)<br />
    = 0.740
</blockquote>

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>The map collected data from 72,730 tracts in 50 states from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/2012_release/">American Community Survey 2012-5year data release.</a></p>

<p>Income data was collected from <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_B19301&prodType=table">per-capita income in the past 12 months (in 2012 inflation-adjusted dollars)</a>. This data was used directly.</p>
    
<p>Mean years of schooling was calculated using <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_B15003&prodType=table">educational attainment for the population 25 years and over</a> and <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_B01001&prodType=table">sex by age</a> for the number of people over 25 years old. Education durations were assigned to each attainment level, and divided by the population over 25 as described above.
</p>

<p>Expected years of schooling was more complicated, <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_B14001&prodType=table">using school enrollment by level of school for population 3 years and older</a>. Again, an education duration was assigned to each level, and matched up with corresponding age groups from the <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_B01001&prodType=table">sex by age</a> table. Initial results were noisy at the grade school level, so education through 8th grade was assumed, and EYS calculated using enrollment ratios for 9th-12th grade, undergraduate, and graduate school. The UN HDI caps EYS at 18-years; this mostly affects areas immediately adjacent to Universities.
</p>    

<p>The <a href="http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a> <a href="http://ghdx.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/record/united-states-adult-life-expectancy-state-and-county-1987-2009">publishes LE estimates</a> (1987-2009) for each county in the United States. LE estimates for each Census tract would be preferable, but this data is only available for a few counties (such as <a href="http://www.societyhealth.vcu.edu/Page.aspx?nav=204">Alameda County, CA</a>) where deaths have been geocoded to exact locations. Note that because I only have county-level data, you may see interesting artifacts in places such as Baltimore, MD.
</p>


<h2>Goalposts</h2>

<p>As described above, each component of the HDI is normalized to the global observed min and max values. A study could select global goalposts, or local values from the region being studied. I experimented with both approaches, and decided to use the global goalposts from the 2013 UN HDI. Note: In any instance where an individual HDI component exceeded 1.0, it was capped at 1.0. This happened most commonly with the Education Index near college towns, and in some very high income Census tracts.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Sanity check:</strong> I was initially concerned that my attempts to map American Community Survey data to the UN's HDI data would be wildly off, but in the end the median values were not too far off from the published UN HDI values. The differences may be that I used <em>median</em> income per-capita instead of <em>average</em> income per capita, and I may have counted an extra year of expected schooling (kindergarten?). As such, the values for an individual Census tract may give a rough "feel" for comparing against the published HDI of another country, but exact comparisons are unlikely to be useful.

<h2>The Map</h2>

<p>The map shows all 72,730 tracts, of which I was able to calculate an HDI for 72,216 tracts (exclude zero population, missing data, etc). The tracts are colored by the relative HDI within the United States. The colors are chosen such that 10% of the population, about 31 million people, live within each color. Incomes tend to be lower in rural areas than highly urbanized areas, so the immediate impression is that vast areas of the United States are relatively undeveleoped. However, zoom in to a metropolitan area and you can see the highly concentrated pockets of wealth, typically in first-ring suburbs and exurban areas.

<h2>Future work</h2>

<p>Well, this was first "real" map I've made using Census data, PostGIS, TileMill, Mapbox, etc. It was a learning experience as much as interest in answering the original question. Please feel free to send any comments my way on twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/woolie">@woolie</a>. In the likely event I've made a terrible error or oversight, I'd love to hear your thoughts!</p>

<p>Finally, here is the <a href="https://github.com/irees/cityism/blob/master/query_hdi.py">code I used to generate the map</a>, and a <a href="http://pages.ianrees.net/maps/hdi.csv">CSV export</a> of all the attributes I calculated.</p>
