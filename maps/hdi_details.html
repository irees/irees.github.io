What if we disaggregated and mapped instead by census tract.

Data:

The United Nation's Development Programme Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite measure of Life Expectancy, Education, and Income levels. It is commonly used to provide a single value for comparing development levels between different countries, but can also be used in a "disaggregated" manner to look at relative differences within a single country, ethnic group, gender, etc.

The HDI is a value from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being the highest possible level of development. It is calculated as the geometric mean of the three component indexes:
Income
Life Expectancy
Education

The values for normalizing the indices are called "goalposts", and are based on the minimum and maximum observed values for each data input. For instance, world life expectancy ranges from X in Y to I in J.

This map applies a modified United Nations Development Programme Human Development Index (HDI) - a composite measure of Life Expectancy, Education, and Income levels - to 74,133 census
tracts in the United States. Additional details.
